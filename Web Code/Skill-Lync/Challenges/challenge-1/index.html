                <!-- Add content for Ethnic Wear section -->
                <p>It’s a re-iterated fact that India inhabits cultural heritage, and in large amounts . And we usually define cultures by the food, rituals, and clothing of a community or state. Indian fashion began to take a flight upwards in the 1980s with the emergence of fashion experts. These experts turned into fashion designers and formed the ideal Indian ethnic wear. Soon, the economy boomed. The country found itself exposed to global fashion trends. There was a fashion boom during the 1990s, which helped establish India's fashion industry . The introduction of “Indian Couture Weeks” was the biggest example. Indian ethnic wear began to include lehengas and traditionally-woven sarees with unique draping. Following this, there was a surge in Indian Kurtas and Kurtis.</p>
                <p>Nothing can match the elegance and charm that Indian ethnic wear brings to a woman’s wardrobe. Since times immemorial, Indian ethnic sets have a permanent space in women’s closets. And the ritual continues even now. Be it sarees, lehengas, or Kurtas, ethnic sets have been women’s first pick to display Indian elegance. <br>
                    The new fashion trends continue to emerge in the ethnic wear arena. And with the coming of new trends, women's inclination towards ethnic fashion increased. The meaning of ethnic wear changed as the trends altered. A wide range of Kurtas came into existence ranging from pocket Kurtas to jacket Kurtas. Uniquely-styled trendy <br> Kurtas and occasion Kurtas have also made their space under ethnic wear. The alterations soon re-invented the definition of ethnic wear. It was no more confined to sarees or suits. The ethnic range had surpassed the range of western wear. Many other kinds of Kurtas, Kurtis, tunics and tops made their way into ethnic wear. And women were all so glad, for now, they could wear a fusion of traditional and modern.
                    Since you’re here, it’s clear that you want to know the meaning of ethnic wear and what comes under it. But before we move on to that, let’s first know the roots of ethnic wear.</p>
